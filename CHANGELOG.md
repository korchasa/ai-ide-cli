and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04-18

### Added

- Initial release as standalone package, extracted from the
  [korchasa/flowai-workflow](https://github.com/korchasa/flowai-workflow)
  monorepo. Git history for library files preserved via `git filter-repo`.
- Thin wrappers around Claude, OpenCode, and Cursor CLIs (`claude/process`,
  `opencode/process`, `cursor/process`).
- Runtime adapter layer (`runtime/`) with a stable interface across the three
  supported IDE runtimes.
- HITL MCP server for OpenCode (`opencode/hitl-mcp`).
- SKILL.md parser and typed skill model (`skill/`).
- Process registry with cross-runtime shutdown handling (`process-registry`).

### Notes

- No code changes from `@korchasa/ai-ide-cli@0.2.0` as published from the
  monorepo — this release is a pure repository split.
- Consumers continue to import via `jsr:@korchasa/ai-ide-cli@^0.2.0`; no
  version bump required on their side.
